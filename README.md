# InefficientFutileSearch
An incredibly inefficient attempt to factor a number that is too large to have any hope of success

Many years ago, I defined [Pete's Number](https://www.esgeroth.org/stuff/p/petesnumber/), a 75087-digit number.

In 2021 I decided to see how far I could get factoring it. So far there are four known factors:

* 19
* 53
* 25715687
* 190528216559

I have very low hopes of finding all factors, but for some reason I've embraced the futility and am trying to at least find a fifth factor.

Even with an efficient algorithm, this would probably be an exercise in futility. And the efficient algorithms tend to have high storage requirements. I want something with low storage requirements and that is easy to pause/resume. I also didn't want to put a lot of time into coding this. So this is an incredibly hacky, ugly, inefficient piece of code. You should probably just turn around now.
